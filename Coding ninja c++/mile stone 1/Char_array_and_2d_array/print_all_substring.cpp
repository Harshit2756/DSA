/*For a given input string(str), write a function to print all the possible substrings.
Substring
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. 
Example: "cod" is a substring of "coding". Whereas, "cdng" is not as the characters taken are not contiguous
Input Format:
The first and only line of input contains a string without any leading and trailing spaces. All the characters in the string would be in lower case.
Output Format:
Print the total number of substrings possible, where every substring is printed on a single line and hence the total number of output lines will be equal to the total number of substrings.*/
